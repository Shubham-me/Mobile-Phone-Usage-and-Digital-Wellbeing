Abstract
---
Smartphones have become an indispensable part of our everyday lives, yet there is
growing concern about the possible detrimental effects of excessive screen time. We conducted a survey as students to investigate the consequences of smartphone use on physical health, mental health, academic performance, and social behaviour. Our study concentrated on smartphone usage, which is currently the most popular gadget.

Data Collection: A survey was conducted to gather information from students regarding their smartphone usage habits and perceived effects. The survey included questions related to screen time, notifications, productivity, study habits, hostel accommodation, degree pursued, academic year, gender, spectacles usage, class attendance, focus, and mental well-being.

Data Pre-processing and Visualization: The collected data was pre-processed to remove unnecessary columns, handle missing values, and make it more interpretable. Visualization techniques such as bar plots and segmented bar charts were used to present the data in a clear and meaningful way.

Data Analysis and Conclusions: 
Statistical analysis was performed on the data to derive meaningful insights. The analysis focused on the average screen time of students and its distribution. Additionally, comparisons were made between different variables, such as study habits, program pursued, and snack consumption during study hours. Confidence intervals were calculated to provide a measure of uncertainty in the results.
